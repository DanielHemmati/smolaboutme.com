  Hello wip,
</h2>
<p>
  this is a <em>basic</em> example of <strong>smolaboutme.com</strong>. I am using tiptap to create a simple text editor. Some stuff are paid i have to build them myself
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    That's a bullet list with one …
  </li>
  <li>
    … or two list items.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Isn't that great? And all of that is editable. But wait, there's more. Let's try a code block:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">body {
  display: none;
}</code></pre>
