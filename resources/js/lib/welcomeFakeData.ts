I don\'t hate serverless—I just don\'t like surrendering control.</p><p>Self-hosting is not a hobby. It\'s a mindset.</p><strong>I deploy everything through Coolify—because real ops shouldn\'t require a PhD in YAML or sell your soul to a cloud monopoly.</strong><p>If your app can\'t survive without 12 third-party APIs and a "platform," maybe it\'s not your app.</p><blockquote><p>Minimalism in code.

I\'m a <strong>web designer</strong> who sees creativity as a <em>playground</em>—and AI as the <strong>jetpack</strong>.</p><p><strong>AI-generated art</strong> isn\'t replacing imagination; it\'s <em>amplifying</em> it. I use it to prototype faster, moodboard better, and break through creative blocks. Every new model feels like <em>unlocking another layer of possibility</em>.</p><p>I\'m obsessed with <strong>clean UI</strong>, <strong>fluid UX</strong>, and <em>bold ideas</em>. Big fan of <strong>Brett @ Designjoy</strong>—<em>one-man studio vibes</em>, minimal process, maximal output.

        content: '<h1>Derek McKay</h1><p>I write <strong>long-form essays</strong>—often to <em>clarify thought</em>. Writing is thinking.

I believe most people don\'t need more productivity apps—they need <em>philosophy</em>.</p><p><strong>Hot take:</strong> Hustle culture is a symptom of existential confusion. Most people are optimizing for goals they didn\'t choose. I think that\'s tragic—and fixable.</p><p><strong>Hot take #2:</strong> The self-help industry sells clarity but profits from confusion. Read fewer books. Reread better ones.</p><p>I subscribe to axiom #405: <em>If you\'re the smartest person in the room, find a room with better people.</em> But also—maybe get out of the room entirely sometimes.
